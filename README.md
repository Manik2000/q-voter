# q-voter

Web application built with Python and Dash simulating the q-voter model evolution.

If you are interested in how the q-voter model works, check out the `q_voter.pdf` file (in preparation).

If you are intrested in running the application on your own, install needed Python packages and run the `app.py` file.

I hope you'll like it :wink:.
